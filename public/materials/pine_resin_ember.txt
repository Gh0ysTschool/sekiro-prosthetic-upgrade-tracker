A piece of resin that contains a continuously smoldering flame. Can be used to upgrade the Flame Vent.

The resin was found in a black pine within the forests of Mibu Village. The ever-smoldering flames acted as a landmark to find one's way to the village. In time the villagers came to loathe the flames, and the black pines were lost. Those who defended the flame were equally loathed.
