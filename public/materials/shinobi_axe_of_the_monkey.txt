A heavy, black iron axe used by shinobi. Can be fitted to the Shinobi Prosthetic to become a working Prosthetic Tool

This boorish axe is used less for cutting and more for breaking things with its weight.

Once the favoured weapon of a shinobi known as the "Bounding Monkey of the Sunken Valley", it was lost along with his left arm.
