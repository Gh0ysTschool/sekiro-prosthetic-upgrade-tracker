Famed horn-spear once used by Gyoubu Masataka Oniwa. Affix to the Shinobi Prosthetic to create a Prosthetic Tool.
The horn contracts to pull enemies in, also capable of stripping crude armour.
When the horn was broken during the rebellion, Isshin praised it for its "splendid shape", awarding Oniwa with the cross-bladed spear of Shuzen Tamura.
