A large fan made of dyed red Japanses aralia leaves. Can be fit to the Shinobi Prosthetic to become a Prosthetic Tool.

"Divine Abduction through an eight-handed fan. Once is fine, but twice and you'll never return. If abducted, we'll head to Mt. Kongo. At Senpou temple we'll perform virtuous deeds."
