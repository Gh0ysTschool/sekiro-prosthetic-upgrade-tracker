A bundle of Mist Raven feathers. Can be fitted to the Shinobi Prosthetic to create a Prosthetic Tool.
In Usui Forest far to the north of Ashina, live many mysterious birds of prey.
The Mist Raven is the only one to have eluded capture by all who have tried.
Should you somehow manage it, you'll find it gone, only feathers in your grasp.
