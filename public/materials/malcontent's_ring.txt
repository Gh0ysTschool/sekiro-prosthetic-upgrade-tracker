An old ring well-suited for slender fingers. "Kingfisher" is engraved on the underside. Can be used to upgrade the Finger Whistle Prosthetic Tool.

Wearing this ring as you blow the finger whistle will create a somber tune.  The weeping voice is full of solitude and beauty. Possibly somber enough to temporarily quell a voice of rage.
