The slender finger of a young woman. Can be fitted to the Shinobi Prosthetic to create a Prosthetic Tool.

Found in the belly of the Guardian Ape, it is partially digested. There is a shinobi technique called the Finger Whistle that can drive beasts wild.

The one who used it before clearly used it for this purpose, as evidenced by the finger's open hole.
