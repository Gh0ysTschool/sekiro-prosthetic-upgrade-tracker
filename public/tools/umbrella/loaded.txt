A Prosthetic Tool created by fitting an indestructible Iron-ribbed Umbrella to the Arm. Costs Spirit Emblems to use.

When spread open, it will protect against attacks from all directions. Hold it out while moving to protect from light attacks.

But this is an umbrella after all. It won't protect you from low attacks such as sweep attacks.
