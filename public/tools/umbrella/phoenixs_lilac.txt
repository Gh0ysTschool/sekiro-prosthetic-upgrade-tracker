A Loaded Umbrella emblazoned with a purplish-blue phoenix. Costs Spirit Emblems to use.

When spread open, it will protect against attacks from all directions. Hold it out while moving to protect from light attacks.

The blessings of the phoenix fill the umbrella, preventing damage from apparition-type enemies.
