Sabimaru blessed with the favor of the Fountainhead Lapis Lazuli. Cost Spirit Emblems to use.

The combination of Lapis Lazuli and the rusted blue blade produces a poisonous mist with every swing.

Dissolving the Lapis Lazuli over the blade caused the ancient blue rust to bubble to the blade's surface.
