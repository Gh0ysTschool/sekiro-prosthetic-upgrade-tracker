A loaded Axe with an attached percussion hammer to create flame. Costs Spirit Emblems to use.

Metes out attacks bathed in flame from the axe's blade. Hitting the sparking percussion hammer causes a violent eruption of flames and increases the effective area of the attack.

This is both firearm and heavy axe.
