A Loaded Axe reinforced with a spring mechanism. Costs Spirit Emblems to use.

The strength of the Loaded Axe lies in its heft. The weight allows one to shrug off incoming attacks, and can easily turn a wooden shield into splinters.

Storing and unleashing energy in the spring mechanism allows for large, sweeping attacks depite its weight.
