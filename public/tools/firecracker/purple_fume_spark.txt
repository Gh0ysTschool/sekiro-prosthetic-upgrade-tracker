An upgraded Firecracker that uses a purple, smoke-emitting compound gunpowder.

Costs Spirit Emblems to use. The tweaked compound gunpowder is known as " Purple Fume Spark". 

The addition of fatty wax lumps delays the explosion slightly.

Enemies blinded by the blast take slightly more Vitality and Posture damage for a brief period of time.
