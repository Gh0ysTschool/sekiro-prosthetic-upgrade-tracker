Mist Raven fused with crimson feathers. Costs Spirit Emblems to use.

Disappear and displace, like the mist. Can be performed from both the assumed stance and after taking damage. Dyed red to resemble the Great Mist Raven, the feathers vanish in a scorching wake. The great raven is a god of the land, and the touch of gods is to be feared.
