Mist Raven feathers with notches in the tips. Costs Spirit Embles to use.

Disappear like the mist and move away. Can be performed not only from the assumed stance, but also after taking damage.

The slight notches in the tips of the feathers give the appearance of an old Mist Raven. They are there to allow one to dissolve into the mist even more easily.
