An enhanced shuriken that pierces enemies with its sharp blades. Costs Spirit Emblems to use.

These piercing blades retain momentum after landing, and will damage an enemy's Vitality and Posture, even if guarded. Taking a moment to further bend the spring, and build rotational energy will cause the blade to rotate after landing, damaging the enemy multiple times on hit.
