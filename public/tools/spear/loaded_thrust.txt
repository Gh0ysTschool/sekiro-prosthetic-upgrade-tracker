A Loaded Spear reinforced with a spring mechanism. Costs Spirit Emblems to use.

Unleash far-reaching thrust attacks. Lighter enemies struck by the spear may be dragged towards the wielder. Can also tear poorly-fitting armor from heavier foes.

Store energy in the spring mechanism and use its momentum for successive and relentless thrust attacks
