A large fan that creates a vortex of wind. Costs Spirit Emblems to use. 

Gathers and releases a gust of wind, forcing enemies caught by the blast to turn around. Can be waved twice in succession. It is a mild sort of being spirited away that can be returned from quite quickly.

However, it's said that one can only return from being spirited away once, and if taken again, there is no coming back.
