A Prosthetic Tool created by fitting a slender finger to the prosthetic. Costs Spirit Emblems to use.

Its sound will grab an enemy's attention and draw them to the whistle's location. By locking on to a target, only the targeted enemy will hear the whistle.

The sound of the finger whistle enrages beasts, making them unable to distinguish friend from foe.
