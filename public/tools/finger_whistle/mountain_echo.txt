A finger whistle that can create an echo effect. Costs Spirit Emblems to use.

Its sound will grab an enemy's attention and draw them to the whistle's location. By locking on to a target, only the targeted enemy will hear the whistle.

Taking a deep breath before performing a whistle allows for the sound to be delayed.
